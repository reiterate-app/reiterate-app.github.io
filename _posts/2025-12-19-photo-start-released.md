title: Photo Start Released
---

I've released Photo Start, an iOS app for randomly selecting a starting player from a group.

The app uses your phone's camera to scan faces, then runs a selection animation to pick who goes first. It's designed for board games, card games, and other activities where you need a fair way to determine turn order.

Key features:
- Face detection using the device's built-in camera
- Random selection from scanned players
- Reroll capability for multiple rounds
- Swipe-to-delete for managing the player pool

The selection can be triggered by laying your phone flat on a table or tapping the Roll button. The app displays a brief animation before showing the selected player.

For detailed usage instructions, see the [Photo Start User Guide](/photo-start).
