**Effective Date: December 19, 2025**

## Overview

Photo Start ("the app") is designed with privacy in mind. The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## Camera Access

The app requires camera access to detect and track faces for the purpose of randomly selecting a starting player. All face detection processing happens locally on your device using Apple's Vision framework.

## Data Collection and Storage

**Photo Start does not:**
- Create user accounts
- Store face data
- Save images or videos
- Collect personal information
- Transmit data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Share data with third parties

All face detection data is processed in real-time on your device and is discarded immediately after the selection process completes. When you close the app or reset the player pool, all face data is deleted from device memory.

## Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
